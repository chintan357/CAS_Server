## This repo contain the server side code for my semester project - 'Canteen Automation System'.

### It comprises of three modules:

- client
- admin
- server (what this repo is containing...)

## Technology Used:

The server side code is implemented using **Node.js** and its popular framework **Express.js**. I have used those to implement _REST API_ for my project. For database I have used **MonogoDB**.
